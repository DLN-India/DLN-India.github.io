**Hello there**, Be it in CS Engineering or in a Job We all start writing code somewhere.
**Placeholder**
I have composed a guide on becoming a better programmer below I hope you like it! 
**End of Placeholder**

1.	Become a Paradigm polygot- 
Real world oCaml by Yaron minsky
In a fast paced industry mere knowledge of programming languages using Object Oriented Programming or Functional Programming isn't just sufficient. A combination thereof is very much a requim if not a catalyst for alternative or out of the box thinking to solving problems with Programming languages. 

Some exercises worth undertaking 
Try Solving 99 prolog problems
use Tool.golang.org for learning a famous language. 

Dan grossman-Programming language-coursera is an interesting resource well worth anyone & everyone's time (For an Industry veteran or newbie in the software services industry)

2.	Become a Database polygot

There's RDBMS. There are NoSQL Databases. We all know this. Getting a grip on more than one Database solution is a key to cracking a career in Data Science or Software Services. 
	There are all sorts of variants to NoSQL :-DynamoDB,bigtable,redis,spanner(developed at google for disturbed transcational use-targeted at enterprises), Neo4j& memSQL(An in memory DB in growing popularity, used by Uber, AKAMAI etc)
Some Interesting Books worth Purchasing: 
Dmitri Fontaine’s Mastering postgesSQL
Baron shwartz High performance MySQL
Dynamodbguide.com has an interesting getting started guide on NoSQL DBs using Amazon's AWS as a primary example. 
3.	Become Protocol polygot TCP/IP, HTTP,UDP,FTP
Must know : SSL,TLS,Applayer Intergrations
 		Sockets and ports
High performance browser networking
Read up RFC 7231 (about 90 pages) first instead of RFC2616(more recent but way too long)
Generally read RFC and citations on G search results
(**Lookup most used RFC (or) most cited)
4.Proficiency with build tooling ,packaging and distribution 
•	Being able to tweak the tools,build/change whats needed
•	Maven,python packaging ,depency injection
 MSBUILD ,nuget;system.IO.Packaging ,ms build packaging
 Dependency Injection tools/frameworks such as 
•	1. Castle Windsor 
•	2. Simple injector
•	3. Microsoft.Extensions.Dependency injection
•	4. Autofac DI container
Additionally:
    Write your own build tooling. 
    Compile/run multi-file program
	5.Ability to analyze reason about and debug programs

	6.Deplyments infrastructure & devops                  Linuxacademy.com has a great bunch of hands-on-labs. 
	Capistrano deployment system                          qwiklabs.com also has similar hands-on-labs.
Software Architecting principles and basic scaling techniques.
- how to design everyday system
- how to use workers,queues and sync processing
- how to design a data pipeline
- data brics and data pipeline design guide
Books:
Martin kleppman’s Designing Data Intensive Apps
Michel keeling Design It
Gayle laakman- cracking the coding interview -Interesting resource to lookup on potential architecting questions. 
Vasantk & Donnemartin's github repo's on Architecting systems. 
7. ABILITY TO WRITE TOY GAMES
(good interview skills,tetris in an hour)
-write a bot that plays the game you make 
-make a game like minesweeper,snake,jumperfrog
8. ALGORITMIC ANALYSIS ABILITY AND SOLVING ALGO PROBS
-ability to solve problems recursively
-understand the master method to analyze recursive solutions
