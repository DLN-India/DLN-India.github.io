## Become a Paradigm polygot

In a fast paced industry mere knowledge of programming languages using Object Oriented Programming or Functional Programming isn’t just sufficient. A combination thereof is very much a requim if not a catalyst for alternative or out of the box thinking to solving problems with Programming languages.

Some exercises worth undertaking:

*   Try Solving 99 prolog problems
*   use [Tool.golang.org](Tool.golang.org) to learn GO!
*   [Dan grossman's Programming language course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages "Dan grossman's Programming language course on coursera") is an interesting resource well worth anyone & everyone’s time (For an Industry veteran or newbie in the software services industry).
*   For Functional Programming 
    *   [Real world oCaml by Yaron minsky](realworldocaml.org)
    *   [Domain Modelling Made Functional](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional)

## Become a Database polygot

There’s RDBMS. There are NoSQL Databases. We all know this. Getting a grip on more than one Database solution is a key to cracking a career in Data Science or Software Services. There are all sorts of variants to NoSQL :-

*   DynamoDB,
*   bigtable,
*   redis,
*   spanner(developed at google for disturbed transcational use-targeted at enterprises),
*   Neo4j& memSQL(An in memory DB in growing popularity, used by Uber, AKAMAI etc)

Some Interesting Books worth Purchasing:

*   Dmitri Fontaine’s Mastering postgesSQL
*   Baron shwartz High performance MySQL
*   Dynamodbguide.com has an interesting getting started guide on NoSQL DBs using Amazon’s AWS as a primary example.

## Become Protocol polygot TCP/IP, HTTP,UDP,FTP

Must know : SSL,TLS,Applayer Intergrations sockets and ports

*   High performance browser networkingRead up RFC 7231 (about 90 pages) first instead of RFC2616(more recent but way too long)
    *   (As a general tip find and read RFCs with the most citations on Google search results).
*   Most cited RFC have certain additional resources(or perspectives) to further lookup and explore.(**Lookup most used RFC (or) most cited)

## Proficiency with build tooling, packaging and distribution

*   Being able to tweak the tools,build/change whats needed
*   Maven,python packaging
*   MSBUILD, nuget;
*   system.IO.Packaging,
*   Dependency Injection tools/frameworks such as
    *   Castle Windsor 
    *   Simple injector 
    *   Microsoft.Extensions.Dependency injection 
    *   Autofac DI containerAdditionally:
*   Write your own build tooling. 
*   Proficient to compile/run multi-file programs

## Ability to analyze reason about and debug programs

*   Reading &reviewing code
*   Debug running programs
*   Observability & instrumentation
    *   Inculcate observability in your process of writing software.
    *   [honeycomb.io](honeycomb.io) 's Observability Guide.
    *   Cindy Sridharan's Observability Book
*   Bart de Smet's Pluralsight course on ILSpy is full of good information.
    *   takes a look at how C# Language features work under the hood. 
*   Julia Evans' talk about her building rbspy is the rough equivalent on RoR

Optionally: Read the ptrace manpage.

A good reflection question :-

"How can I reliably answer a question about a system, without prying open the system?"

## Deployments infrastructure & devops

*   Linuxacademy.com has a great bunch of hands-on-labs.
*   Capistrano deployment system qwiklabs.com also has similar hands-on-labs.
*   Software Architecting principles and basic scaling techniques.
*   how to design everyday systems-how to use workers,queues and sync processing-
*   how to design a data pipeline-data bricks and data pipeline design guideBooks:
    *   [Martin kleppman’s Designing Data Intensive Apps](https://www.snapdeal.com/product/designing-dataintensive-applications-the-big/655545457262?gclid=Cj0KCQjw6sHzBRCbARIsAF8FMpU95O-wa0gcJG2c036H0TDRvz4XpEaCs5A2woZ8_WMLlByx5U6pIesaAt1EEALw_wcB&supc=SDL351962226&utm_source=earth_web&utm_medium=366_1600&utm_content=655545457262&vendorCode=Scbfff&isSellerPage=true&fv=true&utm_source=earth_pla&utm_campaign=60-100_nm&utm_term=71125999396&utm_medium=71125999396&s_kwcid=AL!660!3!352941741275!!!g!403802338450!&ef_id=Xb3kVQAAE7qiU8Fc:20200317173943:s)
    *   Michel keeling Design It
    *   Gayle laakman- cracking the coding interview -Interesting resource to lookup on potential architecting questions.
    *   System Design : [[Vasantk gist](https://gist.github.com/vasanthk/485d1c25737e8e72759f)] & [[Donnemartin’s github repo](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)] on Architecting systems.

## ABILITY TO WRITE TOY GAMES

*   These are good interview skills,
    *   For eg. build tetris in an hour.
*   write a bot that plays the game you make-
*   make a game like
    *   minesweeper,
    *   snake,
    *   jumperfrog etc.

## ALGORITMIC ANALYSIS ABILITY AND SOLVING ALGO PROBS

*   ability to solve problems recursively-understand the master method to analyze recursive solutions
*   Resources:Interiew cake
*   Tim Roughgarden’s: Design and analysis of algorithms (coursera)
